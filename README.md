# Event Calendar and Reminder System (Microservices Architecture)

## Overview
This project is a microservices-based Event Calendar and Reminder System. It is built using Django, Django REST framework, PostgreSQL, and RabbitMQ for inter-service communication. Each microservice operates independently and communicates via RESTful APIs and RabbitMQ.

### Microservices Overview
1. Calendar Service: Manages event creation, updates, and deletion.
2. Reminder Service: Manages scheduling and sending reminders.
3. User Service: Handles user registration, authentication, and preferences.
